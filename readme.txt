🔍 Instantly display a single search result.

== Description ==

You know when you search for something on a site and it finds just one result? You then have to click into it to display it. That's annoying. It's also adding an extra page load which is not necessary.

This plugin simply removes this middle step - if your search returns one result, it will be shown in all its post/page/whatever (delete as appropriate) glory. As well as a quicker answer for your visitor, removing this improves your site's sustainability (okay, just a little... but every little helps, right?).

The code passes WordPress and WordPress VIP coding standards. Because you're worth it.

Thanks to my co-worker [Kailey](https://profiles.wordpress.org/trepmal/) for [the original code](https://trepmal.com/2011/04/22/redirect-when-search-query-only-returns-one-match/), which I've been happily using on my own site for many years. I thought it was time to share the ♥️.

Please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/dartiss/solo "Github") for the latest code development, planned enhancements and known issues.

== Installation ==

Solo can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

1. Upload the entire `solo-search` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress administration.

It's now ready to go.
